# Prerequisites

Innovation Engine can process prerequisites for documents. This code section tests that the pre requisites functionality works in Innovation Engine.
It will run the following real prerequisites along with a look for and fail to run a fake prerequisite.

You must have completed [Fuzzy Matching Test](fuzzyMatchTest.md) and you must have completed [Comment Test](CommentTest.md)

You also need to have completed [This is a fake file](fakefile.md)

And there are going to be additional \ and ( to throw off the algorithm... 

# Running simple bash commands

Innovation engine can execute bash commands. For example


```bash
echo "Hello World"
```

# Test Code block with expected output

```azurecli-interactive
echo "Hello \
world"
```

It also can test the output to make sure everything ran as planned.
<!--expected_similarity=0.8-->
```
Hello world
```

# Test non-executable code blocks
If a code block does not have an executable tag it will simply render the codeblock as text

For example:

```YAML

# Testing regular comments 

Innovation engine is able to handle comments and actual do fancy things with special comments.

There are comments you can't see here.
<!--This is a test comment in markdown -->


<!--This is a multi line comment in markdown


 in markdown -->

# Testing Declaring Environment Variables from Comments
Innovation Engine can declare environment variables via hidden inline comments. This feature is useful for running documents E2E as part of CI/CD

<!!--
```variables
export MY_VARIABLE=willBeChanged
```
 -->
<!--
Here is an example of that
```variables
export MY_VARIABLE=myVariable
```
-->

```azurecli-interactive
echo $MY_VARIABLE
```


# Test Running an Azure Command
```azurecli-interactive
az group exists --name MyResourceGroup
```

# Next Steps

These are the next steps... at some point we need to do something here
