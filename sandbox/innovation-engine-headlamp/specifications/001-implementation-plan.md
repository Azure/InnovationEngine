# Assistant Plugin: Basic User Experience Implementation Plan

**Status:** In Progress - Updated task statuses based on implementation - June 9, 2025

## Overview

This implementation plan outlines the steps required to develop the Assistant Plugin for Headlamp that provides a basic user experience for interacting with GitHub Copilot within the Headlamp UI. The plugin will enable users to author Executable Documents and manage local Kubernetes clusters through natural language queries.

### Implementation Summary
The basic Assistant Plugin has been successfully implemented with a functional chat interface, Azure AI integration for intelligent responses, and quick start suggestions. The implementation includes all core user interaction features from the specification, including properly styled chat history display, response handling, and state management.

### Remaining Work
Three main areas remain incomplete:
1. **UI Enhancement Features (Tasks 009-010)** - Adding copy-to-clipboard functionality and action buttons for command execution
2. **Testing Completion (Task 011)** - Expanding test coverage for edge cases and integration scenarios
3. **Documentation Finalization (Task 012)** - Completing developer documentation and troubleshooting guides

### Relationship to Other Features
The Assistant Plugin has served as a foundation for more advanced features specified in "002 UI Design for Iterative Authoring" which builds on these basics to provide a more comprehensive document authoring experience. Many planned features from this specification have been enhanced and incorporated into the Exec Doc Editor component.
